**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Session**: Stage 1.2 - Docker & Database Setup + Documentation System
**Output**: 02-stage12.md

---

## Prompts & Actions

### #1
**Your Prompt**: "check the @INIT_PROMPT.md and plan the next steps"
**Did**: Read HANDOFF.md, DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md, BUILD_FLOW/01-setup.md, planned Stage 1.2 tasks
**Result**: ✅ Good - Plan presented with 7 checkboxes to complete
**Notes**: User approved plan to implement Docker & Database infrastructure

---

### #2
**Your Prompt**: "just wondering if that requirements should be installed inside docker container or not?"
**Did**: Explained two options: install on host (recommended for dev) vs Docker-only
**Result**: ✅ Good - User chose host installation
**Notes**: Host install provides better IDE support and faster test feedback

---

### #3
**Your Prompt**: "ok go with recommended solution"
**Did**: Installed requirements.txt on host, ran database tests (7 tests passed)
**Result**: ✅ Good - All tests passing, 93% coverage
**Notes**: Test connection to Dockerized PostgreSQL working from host

---

### #4
**Your Prompt**: "ok i added all files then create a commit with some message and then create a PR to main (use gh cli)"
**Did**: Created git commit with message, pushed branch, created PR #1 using gh CLI
**Result**: ⚠️ Blocked - User rejected commit (contained AI branding)
**Notes**: First attempt included Claude Code attribution without permission

---

### #5
**Your Prompt**: "do not add information about claude code and anthropic to commit messages"
**Did**: Recreated commit without AI branding, pushed, created PR #1 successfully
**Result**: ✅ Good - PR created at https://github.com/bartek-filipiuk/repo-to-cat/pull/1
**Notes**: Important lesson learned about commit message preferences

---

### #6
**Your Prompt**: "ok about stage 1.2 can you create a simple and informative documentation about that we have now, for example we need info about docker and connect to postgres, tests - how to run it etc as a separate docs files so we can back to this and test/check manually. First plan how this docs for stage 1.2 will look like, then we can craft a separate command in @.claude/commands/ so we can craft docs files with one command (when we finished some part od funtionality) - documennation need to be based on current changes in code. Ask me 3 question for clarification about this docs command so we will be sure this will be a good one"
**Did**: Proposed documentation structure and asked 3 clarification questions about scope, automation, and versioning
**Result**: ✅ Good - User answered: B) Multiple focused files, C) Hybrid approach, A) Overwrite existing
**Notes**: Key design decisions for /document-stage command established

---

### #7
**Your Prompt**: "1. B) Create MULTIPLE focused files (separate guides for Docker, Database, Testing) 2. C. 3. A"
**Did**: Created 4 documentation files (docker-setup.md, database-guide.md, testing-guide.md, stage-1.2-summary.md) + /document-stage command
**Result**: ✅ Good - All docs created (36.7 KB total)
**Notes**: Documentation structure: focused guides + stage summary + automation command

---

### #8
**Your Prompt**: "/log-mistake" (analyzing conversation for mistakes)
**Did**: Identified mistake (AI branding in commits), created LL-GIT-001 lesson learned, updated .agent/README.md
**Result**: ✅ Good - Lesson documented with prevention strategies
**Notes**: First git-specific lesson learned created

---

### #9
**Your Prompt**: "ok based on project knowledge like a stack and tah we use 'docker compose' etc create a simple and clear @CLAUDE.md instructions, you cna mention tah we need use @.agent/lessons-learned/ files for better knowledge"
**Did**: Created CLAUDE.md with tech stack, Docker commands emphasis, knowledge base references, workflows
**Result**: ✅ Good - Comprehensive AI assistant instructions created
**Notes**: Emphasized docker compose (space not hyphen), references LL-GIT-001, includes quick start checklist

---

## Summary

**Goal**: Complete Stage 1.2 (Docker & Database) and create documentation system.

**What Was Done**:
- ✅ Implemented full Stage 1.2: Docker, PostgreSQL, Alembic, database tests (7/7 passing)
- ✅ Created PR #1 with clean commits (learned lesson about AI branding)
- ✅ Built documentation system: 4 focused guides + 1 automation command
- ✅ Documented mistake as LL-GIT-001 lesson learned
- ✅ Created CLAUDE.md instructions for future AI assistants

**Outcome**: Stage 1.2 complete, PR ready for review, documentation system established for future stages, lesson learned system in use.

**Next**: Review PR #1, merge to main, begin Stage 1.3 (FastAPI Skeleton).

## Files Created

**Stage 1.2 Implementation:**
- Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml
- app/core/database.py, app/models/database.py
- alembic configuration + initial migration
- tests/unit/test_database.py
- scripts/init_db.sql

**Documentation:**
- docs/docker-setup.md (7.8 KB)
- docs/database-guide.md (11.2 KB)
- docs/testing-guide.md (9.1 KB)
- docs/stages/stage-1.2-summary.md (8.4 KB)

**Automation & Knowledge:**
- .claude/commands/document-stage.md (10.3 KB)
- .agent/lessons-learned/LL-GIT-001-no-ai-branding-commits.md
- CLAUDE.md (5.2 KB)

**Total**: 25 files changed, 2007+ lines added

## Key Decisions

1. **Requirements installation**: Host machine (better dev experience)
2. **Documentation structure**: Multiple focused guides (not single file)
3. **Documentation automation**: Hybrid approach (auto-detect + user input)
4. **Documentation versioning**: Overwrite (always latest)
5. **Commit format**: Clean commits only (no AI branding - LL-GIT-001)
6. **Docker command**: `docker compose` (space, not hyphen)
7. **PostgreSQL port**: 5434 (avoiding conflicts with local 5432)

## Metrics

**Time**: ~2 hours
**Tests**: 7 added, 7 passing
**Coverage**: 93% (core), 92% (database), 90% (models)
**Documentation**: 52.9 KB
**PR**: #1 created and ready
