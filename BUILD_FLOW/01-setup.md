## Prompts & Actions

### #1
**Your Prompt**:
> "ok check the @INIT_PROMPT.md and plan the next stage, do not start coding yet, just summarize me shortly what is the plan for stage 1.2 - complete steps list - no big descriptions"

**Did**: Read INIT_PROMPT.md and HANDOFF.md, prepared Stage 1.2 plan summary
**Result**: ⚠️ Blocked - User rejected ExitPlanMode tool
**Notes**: Stage 1.2 has 7 checkboxes (Dockerfile, docker-compose, DB setup, Alembic migrations)

---

### #2
**Your Prompt**:
> "ok firts i think we need update handoff taht after each stage we need a short summary about what need to be done with git/branches check if PR is ready to my review also test commands which i can run manually also test need to be run after coding each stage. Check if this is in handoff so AI will know always what to do"

**Did**: Analyzed HANDOFF.md structure, identified missing stage completion checklists
**Result**: ✅ Good - Identified gaps in workflow documentation
**Notes**: Found PR workflow exists but missing per-stage test commands and verification steps

---

### #3
**Your Prompt**:
> "update"

**Did**: Updated HANDOFF.md with:
1. Stage Completion Checklist Template (lines 62-95)
2. Stage 1.1 completion checklist (6 items, already done)
3. Stage 1.2 completion checklist (10 items including Docker/DB tests)
4. Stage 1.3 completion checklist (10 items including FastAPI tests)

**Result**: ✅ Good - All completion checklists added successfully
**Notes**: Each stage now has explicit test commands, coverage requirements, and PR readiness checks

**Did**: Generated this conversation flow document
**Result**: ✅ Good - Concise session documentation created

## Summary

**Goal**: Add stage completion checklists to HANDOFF.md so AI knows test commands and PR workflow for each stage.

**Outcome**: ✅ Successfully added template + 3 stage-specific checklists with Docker tests, pytest commands, coverage checks, and git/PR verification steps.

**Next**: Ready to implement Stage 1.2 (Docker & Database Setup) following new checklist format.

**Files Modified**:
- `HANDOFF.md` (4 additions: template + stages 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 checklists)

**Key Decision**: Each stage checklist now includes executable test commands user can run manually for verification before PR review.
