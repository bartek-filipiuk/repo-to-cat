# Conversation Flow - Repo-to-Cat Init Session

**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Prompts:** 6
**Result:** ✅ Planning Complete

---

## #1: Project Initialization
**Asked:** Build MVP for GitHub repo → cat image generator with LangChain/LangGraph
**Did:** Fetched docs (LangChain, LangGraph, OpenRouter, Together.ai via Context7), asked 10 clarifying questions
**Result:** ✅ Good
**Notes:** Decided FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Docker stack

---

## #2: Requirements Clarification
**Asked:** Answered 10 questions + added database requirement
**Did:** Confirmed requirements, asked 3 follow-up questions (DB scope, health check, response detail)
**Result:** ✅ Good
**Notes:** Database in MVP, return full analysis JSON + image

---

## #3: Final Specs
**Asked:** Include DB in MVP, add health check, return detailed JSON
**Did:** Created PRD (450 lines), HANDOFF (350 lines, 150+ checkboxes), PROJECT_STRUCTURE
**Result:** ✅ Good
**Notes:** LangGraph 10-node pipeline, 13 dev stages defined

---

## #4: Technical Decisions
**Asked:** Use gemini-2.5-flash, GitHub API (no download?), FLUX.1.1-pro 768x432
**Did:** Updated PRD with model specs, added GitHub Contents API strategy (no cloning needed)
**Result:** ✅ Good
**Notes:** GitHub API reads files directly, works with any repo size

---

## #5: File Selection Strategy
**Asked:** Which 3-5 files to analyze? Language-based strategy?
**Did:** Created FILE_SELECTION_STRATEGY (400 lines) with 5-priority algorithm
**Result:** ✅ Good
**Notes:** Priority: README → Entry point → Core → Test → Config (language-aware)

---

## #6: TDD Workflow Simulation
**Asked:** Simulate Stage 1.1 workflow, when to write tests?
**Did:** Detailed Stage 1.1 simulation (5 checkboxes), explained TDD approach
**Result:** ✅ Good
**Notes:** Tests FIRST for logic (config), manual verification for dirs/docs

---

## Summary

**Planning Complete:** 5 docs created (~2,000 lines)
- PRD with tech stack, API specs, database schema
- HANDOFF with 150+ checkboxes across 13 stages
- PROJECT_STRUCTURE with directory hierarchy
- FILE_SELECTION_STRATEGY with 5-priority algorithm
- CONVERSATION_FLOW with technical analysis

**Key Decisions:**
- Stack: FastAPI + LangGraph + gemini-2.5-flash + FLUX.1.1-pro
- GitHub: Contents API (no cloning), 3-5 file analysis
- Workflow: 10-node pipeline, TDD approach
- Database: PostgreSQL with generations tracking

**Status:** Ready for Stage 1.1 implementation
