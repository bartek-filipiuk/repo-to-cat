# ðŸš€ Repo-to-Cat: Init Prompt

Use this to start/continue work on Repo-to-Cat in a new conversation.

## ðŸ“‹ Main Initialization Prompt

```
I'm working on "Repo-to-Cat" - GitHub repository analyzer that generates cat images based on code quality.

CONTEXT FILES (read in order):
1. @HANDOFF.md - Development checklist (150+ checkboxes, 13 stages) - CHECK THIS FIRST
2. @DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md - TDD workflow, commit format, testing rules
3. @PRD.md - Product requirements, API specs, tech stack (reference only)
4. @01-setup.md or latest session file - Previous session summary

TECH STACK:
- Backend: FastAPI, Python 3.11+, PostgreSQL
- AI: LangChain 0.3.0 + LangGraph 0.2.74
- LLM: OpenRouter (google/gemini-2.5-flash)
- Image: Together.ai (FLUX.1.1-pro, 768x432)
- GitHub: PyGithub + Contents API (no cloning)
- Testing: pytest + pytest-asyncio (80% coverage)

WORKFLOW:
1. Check @HANDOFF.md for current stage and next checkbox
2. Work on ONE checkbox at a time
3. For code: TDD (tests first, then implement)
4. After each checkbox: run tests, request review, mark âœ…
5. Follow stage completion checklist before creating PR

```

### Start Specific Stage
```

## ðŸ”„ Stage Completion Process

Before creating PR for each stage:

1. âœ… All stage checkboxes marked complete
2. âœ… Run: `pytest tests/ -v --cov=app --cov-report=term`
3. âœ… Coverage â‰¥ 80% for new code
4. âœ… Stage-specific verification (see HANDOFF.md completion checklist)
5. âœ… All tests passing
6. âœ… Committed on feature branch: `feature/stage-X.Y-description`
7. âœ… Create PR to `main` with `gh pr create`
